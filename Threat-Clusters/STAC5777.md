# Checklist

### Spam and Social Engineering
#### Identify Spam Activity:
- Confirm spam email bombardment targeting individuals.
- Investigate inbound Microsoft Teams messages claiming to be from internal IT.
#### Verify Teams Call Activity:
- Confirm adversaries requested a Teams call to address spam issues.
- Check if users were guided to install software during the call.
### Initial Access
#### Investigate Quick Assist Usage:
- Verify if Microsoft Quick Assist was installed and used for remote sessions.
- Confirm Office365 account helpdesk@llladminhlpll.onmicrosoft.com initiated communications from IP 78.46.67[.]201.
#### Review Device Access:
- Confirm users granted remote control through Quick Assist.
### Execution
#### Analyze Execution of Malicious Components:
- Verify execution of OneDriveStandaloneUpdater.exe, which side-loaded winhttp.dll.
- Confirm winhttp.dll:
- Loaded configuration information from settingsbackup.dat.
- Connected to manually configured IP addresses added to the system.
#### Inspect Parent Processes for Initial Activity:
- Key processes and their command lines:
- RuntimeBroker.exe: Launching Edge browser for Quick Assist.
- svchost.exe: Running Quick Assist app.
- Explorer.exe > cmd.exe: Command shell used for payload deployment.
- cmd.exe: Decompressing pack.zip with tar.
- cmd.exe: Running OneDriveStandaloneUpdater.exe.
### Persistence
#### Review Persistence Mechanisms:
- Confirm creation of a PowerShell command that:
- Configured a service to auto-run OneDriveStandaloneUpdater.exe.
- Created a .lnk file in the startup folder to maintain persistence after reboot.
- Verify additional manual configuration changes made via command shell.
### Discovery
#### Scan for Hosts and Services:
- Confirm if OneDriveStandaloneUpdater.exe conducted SMB protocol scans to map online hosts.
- Verify scans for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and Windows Remote Management (WinRM) hosts.
### Lateral Movement
#### Credential Usage for Lateral Access:
- Investigate use of targeted userâ€™s credentials to expand access:
- Check VPN login activity.
- Confirm use of credentials to access RDP hosts within the network.
- Verify if Windows Remote Management (WinRM) was used for movement between hosts.
### Defense Evasion
#### Evade Security Mechanisms:
- Verify backdoor usage to:
- Uninstall local multifactor authentication integration.
- Attempt (unsuccessfully) to uninstall the Sophos Endpoint Agent.
### Credential Gathering and Data Exfiltration
- Search for Sensitive Information:
- Confirm if the threat actor accessed local files with keywords like "password" in their names using notepad.exe or Word.
- Investigate use of mstsc.exe to access and edit .rdp files for stored credentials.
- Check for access to network diagrams (e.g., Visio files) to plan further lateral movement.
### Command and Control (C2)
#### Inspect C2 Communications:
- Verify IP addresses used by OneDriveStandaloneUpdater.exe for C2 connections:
- 74.178.90[.]36:443.
- 195.123.241[.]24:443.
- Confirm if connections were encrypted using unsigned OpenSSL toolkit drivers.
- Investigate if virtual private servers linked to Russia-based threat actors were involved.
### Registry and Configuration Changes
#### Check Registry Modifications:
- Confirm creation of registry key:
- HKLM\SOFTWARE\TitanPlus.
- Value: "185.190.251.16:443;207.90.238.52:443;89.185.80.86:443".
- Verify IP addresses provided by the key for C2 connections.
### Impact
#### Attempted Ransomware Execution:
- Confirm if threat actors attempted to execute Black Basta ransomware.
