# Checklist

### Initial Access
####  Identify Incident Trigger:
- Employee reported receiving an unusually high volume of spam messages (3,000+ within 45 minutes).
- Received a suspicious Teams call from an external account named “Help Desk Manager.”
#### Investigate Remote Session:
- Determine if a remote screen control session was allowed through Teams.
- Confirm if a command shell was opened by the attacker.
- Check for any files dropped, including Java archive (JAR) files, a .zip archive, and Python code.
#### Verify File Sources:
- Review external SharePoint file store for the source of deployed files.
### First Stage Execution
 #### Review JAR File Execution:
- Ensure that MailQueue-Handler.jar was executed using javaw.exe (Java “headless” runtime).
- Identify the role of UTF-8 encoding (via chcp 65001) and PowerShell execution bypass in the attack.
 #### Validate Command Execution:
- Check the use of WMIC.exe to retrieve Java runtime process IDs.
- Review the execution of PowerShell commands that bypassed execution policies and AMSI detection.
#### Examine File Downloads:
Confirm if PowerShell downloaded:
- na.7z (7zip archive).
- 7za.dll (7zip utility dynamic link library).
- 7za.exe (7zip utility executable).
- Validate the extraction of contents, including ProtonVPN executable and malicious nethost.dll.
### Discovery
#### Check for User Information Collection:
- Investigate the use of whoami.exe to obtain usernames.
- Validate the use of net.exe and net1.exe to discover network resources accessible to the user.
### Sideload / Command and Control
 #### Verify DLL Sideloading Activity:
- ProtonVPN executable (ProtonVPN.exe) sideloaded nethost.dll.
Confirm connections to virtual private servers (VPS) hosted in:
- Russia: 207.90.238[.]99
- Netherlands: 206.206.123.75
- US: 109.107.170[.]2, 195.133.1[.]117
#### Review Behavioral Detections:
- Check for endpoint protection alerts regarding unsigned DLL sideloading.
### Second Java Execution
#### Analyze Command Sessions:
- Examine the execution of cmd.exe to configure UTF-8 encoding (chcp 65001).
- Confirm PowerShell was used with execution policy bypass.
#### Inspect Second JAR File:
Validate identity.jar execution by javaw.exe with parameters for:
- Target username.
- Active Directory domain.
### Archive Utility and Python Malware Deployment
 #### Track Archive Extraction:
- Confirm tar.exe was used to extract winter.zip to C:\ProgramData\.
- Verify Python malware and supporting files were deployed.
#### Investigate Local Discovery Commands:
Check execution of:
- net.exe and net1.exe for time and date information.
- nltest.exe for domain controller discovery.
- PING.EXE to resolve domain controller IP addresses.
- ipconfig.exe for local network configuration.
### Execution of Malicious Python Payload
 Validate Payload Execution:
- Ensure debug.exe (renamed Python interpreter) launched 45_237_80.py backdoor script.
